  Semicolon Software Solutions is a hard working group of young software engineering students
  destined for greatness. We work hard to bring the best solutions to any type of software project
  and look forward to bringing our newest upcoming project right to our own faculty here at Western
  Engineering Undergraduate Services.

<p style="font-size:120%">
  Semicolon Software Solutions prides itself on every solution we create. Semicolon Software Solutions stems from a 
  large root of programming where semicolons are always at the end of the line. At Semicolon Software Solutions, 
  we promise to always get to the end of the line no matter how hard we have to work, and no matter how much time we have to put into it. 
  We will make software great again, one line at a time.
